     * The TouchEvent class lets you handle events on devices that detect user contact with the device (such as a finger
     * on a touch screen).When a user interacts with a device such as a mobile phone or tablet with a touch screen, the
     * user typically touches the screen with his or her fingers or a pointing device. You can develop applications that
     * respond to basic touch events (such as a single finger tap) with the TouchEvent class. Create event listeners using
     * the event types defined in this class.
     * Note: When objects are nested on the display list, touch events target the deepest possible nested object that is
     * visible in the display list. This object is called the target node. To have a target node's ancestor (an object
     * containing the target node in the display list) receive notification of a touch event, use EventDispatcher.addEventListener()
     * on the ancestor node with the type parameter set to the specific touch event you want to detect.
